### 1 - Extract the repository's files in a folder of your choosing

### 2 - Setup the virtual environment :


In your command bash/shell go in the folder containing the files

Type :  
Windows :
```
py -m venv venv
```
Unix/mac :
```
python3 -m venv venv
```


You then need to activate the virtual environment :  
Windows :
```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
Unix/mac :  
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
(venv) should now be displayed to the left of your command line :
```
(venv) C:\>
```

### 3 - Run the script

You can now run the script of your choosing by simply typing :
```
bruteforce.py
```
or
```
optimized.py
```

Do note you need to have the "data.csv" file in the same folder as the "bruteforce.py" file if you want to run the bruteforce script.
